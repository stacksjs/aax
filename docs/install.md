## Requirements

Before using `aax`, make sure you have:

1. `ffmpeg` installed and available in your PATH
2. `audible-cli` installed and available in your PATH (or in your project root)

### Installing FFmpeg

```sh
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg
```

### Installing Audible CLI

1. Download the appropriate binary from [Audible CLI Releases](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli/releases)
2. Place it in your PATH or project root
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x audible`

Read more about how to use it in the Usage section of the documentation.
